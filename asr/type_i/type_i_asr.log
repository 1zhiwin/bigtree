Host:    ouc-smp (AVX2, FMA3, 125 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree -s ../../msa/type_i/type_i_alignment_trimmed.faa -te ../../trees/type_i/type_i_tree.treefile --ancestral -m LG+G4 --prefix type_i_asr
Seed:    608628 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Sun Nov  9 12:51:32 2025
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (32 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 32 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.
